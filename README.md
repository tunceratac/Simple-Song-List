# Simple Song List

C program in which you can create a simple song list. You must use given data structures and implement given methods properly. The user of the program must be able to

● add a song to the list by providing its name and duration

● delete a song from the list by providing its name

● list all songs

Your implementation must satisfy these constraints below:

● You must use the dynamic_array data structure for storing songs. The initial capacity of the dynamic_array must be 2, and you must allocate 2 void* in the heap by using malloc() and assign NULL value to them. elements pointer must store the returned address from malloc(). Implement these operations in the init_array function.

● When the user chooses to add a new song you must create that song in the heap by using malloc(). You must put this song address into the songs by using the put_element function. In the put_element function you must increase the size of the elements array and put the newly added element’s address into the elements array. Emplace it to the first available position.

● When the user chooses to delete the song, you must find it by using get_element function, and use free() function to deallocate them from the heap. And use remove_element to remove its address from the songs.

● Everytime the size of the dynamic_array reaches capacity you must increase the capacity to 2 times the old one, and copy the elements of the elements array into the new allocated elements array. You must assign NULL value for elements array elements that haven’t pointed to any valid songs yet. All these operations must be implemented in the put_element function.

● Everytime the size of the dynamic_array drops down to capacity/2, reduce capacity by factor of 2 and allocate space for that capacity, copy the values of the elements array to the newly allocated elements array and deallocate the old elements array by using free() function. All these operations must be implemented in the remove_element function.

● While you list the songs you must use the get_element function to get the song address at that position. Note that get_element returns void*, so you can cast the type of void* to song*, and then access the song fields.

Notes:

● The elements field of dynamic_array is a pointer that stores the address of elements rather than elements as values. You can regard elements as an array of void*.

● The heap mentioned above is not a data structure, it is the memory region. You can create or manipulate an object on the heap by using dynamic memory allocation functions(e.g. malloc(), free() etc.) declared in stdlib.h

● NULL is also declared in stdlib.h, it is used as an address that points to 0 which means there is no valid data at that address, or the data hasn't been allocated yet. To indicate the pointer hasn't been initialized yet or the pointed value deallocated, you can use NULL.

char* myptr = NULL;

● void* is a general purpose pointer that helps you to store an object without knowing the actual pointed data type. You can cast it to the actual pointed data type. E.g.

void* myptr = malloc(sizeof(int)); //Allocates 4 bytes space on the heap

int* my_num_ptr = (int*) myptr; //Cast it to int*, we are allowed to do since we allocate 4 bytes

*my_num_ptr = 25; // Change the value at that address through our int*

printf("%d", *my_num_ptr);  //Prints 25

printf("%d", *((int*)myptr)); //Prints 25
